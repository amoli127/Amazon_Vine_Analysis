# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
This analysis aims to examine whether there is any bias in favor of positive reviews among Amazon Vine program members. The Vine program is a service that enables manufacturers and publishers to obtain reviews for their products. Through this project, we analyzed a particular dataset containing reviews for video games. The goal is to provide a summary of the analysis to SellBy stakeholders.

## Results

- **How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?**

  There was a total of 94 Vine reviews and 40,471 non-Vine reviews.

- **How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?**

  Out of the 94 Vine reviews, 48 reviews were five stars. On the other hand, out of 40,471 non-Vine reviews, 15,663 were five stars.

- **What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?**

  There were 51.06% of Vine reviews of five stars and 38.70% of non-Vine reviews of five stars.

## Summary

Based on the analysis, we found a positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Paid reviews had a higher percentage of 5-star reviews (51.06%) compared to unpaid reviews (38.70%). This suggests that participating in the Vine program may influence a reviewer's rating.

One additional analysis we could do to support this statement is to examine the distribution of star ratings for both paid and unpaid reviews. If we find that paid reviews have a higher concentration of 5-star ratings and a lower concentration of 1-star ratings compared to unpaid reviews, it will support the statement of a positivity bias in the Vine program.
